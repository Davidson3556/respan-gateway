#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! Fallback: transport-neutral attempt control, which the router's routes
//! (`respan_gateway_plugin_routing::Dispatch`) and other plugins use:
//! sequential retries and fallback ([`first_success`], [`Backoff`]), a
//! staggered race ([`race`]), and each attempt's [`Role`] ([`Attempt`]).
//! The caller supplies a retry classifier; HTTP callers can use
//! `respan_gateway_http_faults::retryable`.
//!
//! Both helpers read each answer [`Until`] a stopping point, using a
//! plugin-supplied predicate for [`Until::content`]: they return a success
//! only once it got there, and never retry after that, so a stream that fails
//! later reaches the client cut short, not replayed. An attempt policy
//! routes do not cover is a few lines of `on_client`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let calls = ["openai", "anthropic"].map(|p| cx.call(p));
//! let backoff = Backoff::new(3, Duration::from_millis(200), Duration::from_secs(10));
//! first_success(calls, &backoff, Until::content(Output::is_content),
//!     respan_gateway_http_faults::retryable).await.map(Some)
//! ```
