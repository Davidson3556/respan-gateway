#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! A tool vendor is an HTTP API offered as tools, the way a vendor of
//! `respan-gateway-vendors` is a model API offered as formats: where it is,
//! how it takes a key, and its tools ([`ToolVendor`]). [`ToolServer`] serves
//! one as an MCP server in process, so a gateway registers it as a provider
//! of the MCP format like any other server, and everything that reaches MCP
//! servers (`/mcp/{name}`, the aggregate `/mcp`, the tool loop) reaches its
//! tools too.
